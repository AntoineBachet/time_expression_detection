Generations yet unborn will face rising oceans and coastal inundations into the 2300s even if governments meet climate commitments
Sea level rise is set to challenge human civilization for centuries to come
Climate goals are met and planet-warming emissions are then immediately eliminated, researchers have found.
Even if governments meet their commitments from the landmark 2015 Paris climate agreement, the first 15-year period of the deal will still result in enough emissions that would cause sea levels to increase by around 20cm by the year 2300
This scenario, modeled by researchers, assumes that all countries make their promised emissions reductions by 2030
The emissions scenario would be from 2015 to 2030 if countries met their Paris agreement obligations
Our results show that what we do today will have a huge effect in 2300
Twenty centimetres is very significant; it is basically as much sea-level rise as we’ve observed over the entire 20th century
To cause that with only 15 years of emissions is quite staggering
300 million people will flood at least once a year by 2050 unless carbon emissions are drastically slashed

Several allies and close friends of the French far-right leader Marine Le Pen are due to go on trial in Paris accused of fraud during election campaigns in 2012
The seven defendants including senior figures in Le Pen’s party, the Front National, which has since been renamed National Rally, will appear in court on Wednesday accused of taking part in a fraudulent scheme to overcharge candidates for party election leaflets
Each candidate standing for election for the Front National in 2012 was obliged to buy an election kit
The price for this kit was €16,650 (£14,325), which was close to the legal amount that candidates who scored more than 5% in the first round could later claim back from the state for election costs
The first allegations relate to elections in 2012
A second investigation relating to elections in 2014 and 2015 will be examined later in court
Amazon and some of its top executives was too close to call early Wednesday 
In 2015, the tech corporation and its employees only contributed about $130,000 to the city council candidates, according to the New York Times
But given that later voters in the city often lean far left, it was difficult to predict in the early hours of Wednesday which candidate would ultimately prevail

The conservative website Project Veritas released video of Robach venting that every day I get more and more pissed that her 2015 interview with Virginia Giuffre was never shown

Giuffre first outlined her allegations against Epstein anonymously in a lawsuit filed in 2009, and she did her first on-the-record interviews about them with the Daily Mail in 2011
At the time of ABC’s interview, Giuffre’s lawyers were battling with Dershowitz, who was fighting back against her claim that he was among the men who had sex with her when she was a minor
At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story
Robach said in her statement Tuesday that she had been referring in the video to what Giuffre had said in the interview, not what ABC News had verified through its own reporting
In the years since, no one has ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein, and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story.
ABC says it plans to air a two-hour documentary and six-part podcast on the Epstein case next year

Two days later, after a second fruitless hunt near the ranch, the Barajas family headed south to join another search, though this time not for José
They took him 18 days ago
